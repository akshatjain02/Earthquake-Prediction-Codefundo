# Earthquake-Prediction-Codefundo

Earthquake prediction has been a challenging research area. In this work, we plan to compute sixty seismic features by employing seismological concepts, such as Gutenberg-Richter law, seismic rate changes, foreshock frequency, seismic energy release, total recurrence time. Further, Maximum Relevance and Minimum Redundancy (mRMR) criteria can be applied to extract the relevant features. Using these feaures, a Support Vector Regressor (SVR) and Hybrid Neural Network (HNN) based classification system could prove to be optimal for predicting earthquakes. HNN is a step wise combination of three different Neural Networks, supported by Enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (EPSO), to offer weight optimization at each layer.
